  summary: [
  "Iâ€™m a results-driven technology leader with over a decade of experience guiding organizations from startup through scale and acquisition. My sweet spot is where business strategy and deep technical execution intersect: defining the vision, setting the architecture, and building teams that deliver at speed.",
  "I thrive in cloud-based SaaS environments, particularly enterprise-grade platforms where scale, performance, and customer satisfaction are mission-critical. While industry verticals are less important to me, Iâ€™m especially energized by opportunities to apply AI, machine learning, and data science to drive new value â€” whether as a core capability or as a new feature set.",
  "My leadership philosophy centers on empowering autonomy. I encourage teams to trust their intuition, learn by doing, and fail fast â€” creating a culture where engineers grow quickly and innovation accelerates. Iâ€™m equally comfortable building teams from the ground up or joining an established team to learn their strengths and amplify their success.",
  "At the core, my strengths are dual: Iâ€™m a capable hands-on engineer who can dig into architecture and code, but my true talent is seeing the bigger picture â€” aligning technology with business goals and translating complex requirements into creative, scalable solutions. This balance is sharpened by my early experience in retail and service industries, which gave me a customer-first mindset I still apply today: every stakeholder, whether internal or external, is a customer of Engineering and IT.",
  "Iâ€™ve always been a tinkerer at heart. From taking apart electronics as a kid to tearing down applications today, I seek to understand how things work â€” and then make them better. That drive fuels my passion for building and scaling products, mentoring engineers, and helping organizations achieve ambitious outcomes."
